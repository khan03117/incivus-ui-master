                                    Brands invest highly in terms of time and resources to test their concepts and creatives before launching

                                    there are many shortcomings to the current methods of testing that include surveys and focus groups.

                                            ad copy effectiveness score. This score determines the engagement and the effectiveness of the
                                            Ad to meet your marketing objectives.</li>
                                        <li><b>Recall: </b> Identify the most and least recognizable and memorable frames of your video ads. For

                                        <li><b>Cognitive load: </b>  When consumers are exposed to an overwhelming amount of information, it
                                            can lead to cognitive overload, hindering their ability to make informed decisions. The paralyzing
                                            effect of choice overload, a phenomenon where consumers struggle to decide when presented
                                            with too many options, is a testament to this effect. According to a 2023 Journal of Consumer
                                            Research study, choice overload led to a 27% decrease in consumer satisfaction and a 35%
                                            decrease in the likelihood of repeat purchases.</li>

                                        <li><b>Attention: </b> Identifies where the attention is falling and at what intensity. For video ads, it also
                                            identifies keyframes with the highest concentration of attention.</li>
