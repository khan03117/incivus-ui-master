                                            make a final decision. One of the most common methods of gathering this data is through A/B testing.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                A/B testing, at its most basic, is a way to compare two versions of something to figure out which
                                                performs better. In our case it's about comparing 2 versions or sub-edits of an Ad to see which one will
                                                capture your audience’s attention and deliver for your marketing objectives.

                                                A/B testing feature permissions are required on the Incivus Platform so you can test 2 versions of an Ad.
                                                If you do not see “A/B Testing” as a menu item in the left-hand navigation, you do not have permission
                                                to use this feature. Please reach out to your system admin or write to Incivus at <a href="mailTo:'support@incivus.ai'">support@incivus.ai</a> for
